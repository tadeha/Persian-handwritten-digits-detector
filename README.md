# Persian-handwritten-digits-detector
Detecting Persian handwritten digits using Machine Learning (Offline Prediction) and Deep Learning (Real-time Prediction) and an iOS application.

# Demo

You can watch 2 video examples of this project (one for offline prediction and one for real-time prediction) on the links below:

# Installation

Just clone or download this repository and run the app from the iOS folder! All dependencies are included.

# Usage

Sketch a Persian digit from 0 to 9 on the canvas. The neural network or the machine learning model (depending on the mode you choose) will attempt to classify the image.
